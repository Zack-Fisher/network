[background music: "petscop" ♪]

Alright, so uh, this is just to uh, prove to you

that I'm not lying about this game that I found.

I'm just gonna walk you through

everything that I've seen so far,

and uh, obviously it will be exactly as I described it,

because this is it.

[background music: "gift-plane" ♪]

And uh, the first level is over here.

I'm just gonna keep going a bit here, so you can see that

the game is apparently unfinished because there's nothing over here.

So, I'm just gonna show you the one and only level.

This actually is not the interesting part

but I'm just uh, gonna show you,

I'm gonna walk you through all of this so you can see that this is

exactly what I described.

[background music: "level1" ♪]

So, the first pet is in this room.

And uh, the first thing you gotta do here is uh,

let her out of her cage, and she just moves to the other one.

And then you

do that, take the money here,

and then, actually, you go over here and

she just does that. But if you uh,

do this, if you lock yourself in here, then she just,

Amber will just run over there and

So once you're in here, actually, you can find a little place here to

walk to the other side.

So that's that.

And so there's actually, there's another

pet over here. I can't catch this one.

I've tried.

This is always what happens.

So I don't know what's up with that one.

So uh, actually I should show you the pause menu.

So here you can see all the pets

that you've, uh,

collected.

That you've caught.

Alright, so the second one here is sort of uh, a music one.

the idea here is, you have to get your clone over there to overlap with it.

And uh, I'll just cut to the chase

You just set this to

uh, what is it

seven.

And uh, just like that.

I don't totally get that one,

but that's that.

Alright, so this one's kind of interesting.

Uh, so the idea is

if you run over here to catch the flower here

then you'll just get rained on.

What you're supposed to do is

whenever the flower comes over here, you notice

it always comes to the exact spot over there, which you can uh,

get this bucket

into that exact spot.

That the spot? Yeah.

Then the,

then that happens, and you can just

catch them both that way.

Okay.

So, yeah, that's it for the,

actually that's everything.

That's every single pet here that I've been able to catch.

Uh, so,

now I'm gonna show you the part that's actually interesting.

Alright, so I still can't catch this guy.

The reason we're here is because, in the note that came with this,

which is short, the first line, in all capital letters,

I'm gonna read it, it says:

"I WALKED DOWNSTAIRS"

"AND WHEN I GOT TO THE BOTTOM,"

"INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING,"

"I TURNED THE RIGHT AND BECAME A SHADOW MONSTER MAN."

Below that, a date:

June 13th, 1997

"For you:"

"Please go to my website on the sticker"

"and also go to roneth's room"

"and press start"

"and press down down down down down right start".

So I happen to know that this is Roneth's room, because it works.

So I go here.

I'm just gonna do this now. Uh,

so, what is it, down down down down down right

start.

[music stops]

Alright.

So you can see that it accepted it, and the music stopped.

I'm just gonna go out this way here.

So uh, it appears to be the same, except

when I actually leave here

it'll be a little bit different.

Alright.

So there's uh, nothing out here, as far as I've seen.

But actually, I think there is something out here.

I just haven't seen it yet.

Because

it sure seems like

in this note here, it sure seems like, right,

I'm supposed to come out here and look at something.

I haven't found anything yet, but I'm thinking if I just keep walking around here,

I'm gonna find something eventually, I --

Hey, so I was talking about how I couldn't find anything out here.

Well, I just found this.

And uh,

last time I came out here, I was walking around in this space here

for over an hour.

And this time, I find this in less than fifteen minutes.

So, this is just luck, that I happened to find this.

And uh,

I think if I were to restart my console right now

I would not be able to find this again.

Probably. Because I don't remember what I

what I did.

You know, all the directions that I went.

So um,

so I'm kind of scared to, you know,

I want to keep the console on until I figure this out.

The situation is that I cannot open this door.

Uh, I probably can open the door, but I don't know what to do.

So I thought I would just slip this in at the end.

If you think you saw something that might provide a clue, uh,

please let me know.

Alright. That's it.

[short tune ♪]

Hey, so, uh,

the door opened on its own.

Uh.

I was just in the other room for

a couple of minutes,

and I came back, and the door was open,

and I checked the recording,

'cause I was recording,

and,

the door just opens on its own. I didn't do anything.

So, I'll take it, right? Uh.

So, I'm gonna show you what's in here now,

I haven't seen it yet, so, uh,

this could be interesting.

Huh.

[phone ringing to the left]

Uh.

Yeah?

Hm.

Sorry for not talking very much.

I'm a little bewildered, if you want to know the truth.

This is a little more than I was expecting to see.

That's a dead kid.

I don't know.

So, when I first came down here, I thought

I was just gonna see, like, one room.

Uh. Like, something, but not

this.

Can I go in here?

I can!

Uh.

Oh!

What?

Don't know.

Okay.

Uhhh.

Uhh.

Heh.

[dark sound]

Oh.

[dark sound]

[dark sound]

[dark sound]

Alright, so, it's been like, two minutes,

and, uh, when those sounds were playing, there was nothing...

happening, as far as I could tell,

and nothing has happened since,

so, I'm just gonna keep going.

There's already been stuff

that I could dig a little deeper into,

and, and I'm gonna do that,

uh, and keep you updated.

Uh, but also,

uh, when you come home next month,

and uh, hopefully you're feeling a little more enthusiastic about that now,

we can investigate this together,

and maybe you'll find stuff that I can't find here.

Oh.

[short tune ♪]

Uh, what the fuck?

Wait a second.

What was that, just now?

Can I get that to happen again?

Wait.

Uh.

Hey, sorry, I had to look at that for a moment.

Uh, in the video.

I was a little nervous.

Uh, the tones, I think those were the same tones,

uh, that you might have heard in the beginning,

I'm gonna put in the beginning, the part where the door opened.

Uh.

And also, the way the guy on the other side

was moving for a moment...

I'm gonna

ask for your comment later on that. Um.

So, I was looking around here, so,

this is backwards,

it says, uh, "Do you remember being born?"

Um, and,

this just says "QUITTER'S ROOM".

So, interestingly, I'm on the, uh, reverse side,

here. Uh.

Yeah. Okay, so,

moving on.

And, I'm back up here again.

This again.

Well, okay, I'm not gonna do that right now.

Alright, so, I'm gonna stop this now, actually.


Petscop 3
Alright, so, now we're gonna look at

um, what's over here. Which I,

I forgot about this. So,

gonna look at this now.

Interesting.

What's that?

Do I, uh...

Think I have to put something there.

What?

Um.

Oh?

Okay.

[laughs]

Alright. Okay.

[crumbling]

This is just flat-out a full game that I'm playing now.

What am I supposed to do?

Can I just walk out?

[crumbling stops]

I don't think I was supposed to do that. Yeah.

Uh.

Yeah, I reset it.

Okay, try that again.

[crumbling]

So, do I just wait?

I think that's what I'm supposed to do.

Or I have to put something in there.

[crumbling stops]

Yeah, it turned out I just had to wait,
[crumbling stops]

but I had to wait a while.

Uh.

So, this is cleared out, I guess.

So what's in here?

Uhh. Huh.

Okay.

Well, alright.

Let's try another one, I guess.

So I just did it again. I put in another one of these.

And I just let it go, and it

and the room rumbles for a while, but then it just stops

kind of abruptly.

Uh, so,

what do we have here now?

Yeah.

Uh.

Yeah, so it seems like, I put in one of these faces, and it gives me a room

with, uh,

I guess that's a kid sitting on the bed,

and like, a different

pattern on the floor and the walls, and the

thing here.

So, uh,

it seems like

there are many combinations

of these faces.

So, if I were to guess,

these rooms are... Because there's not much variation between these rooms.

They're probably generated in some way.

Uh, so I'll try a few more. Every time I put in one of these, I have to wait

for like ten minutes, so

I'm not gonna try too many of them.

I'm gonna... yeah.

Here's another one.

And here's another.

Yeah.

So, anything uh, look familiar here?

Yeah. Yeah so,

Probably we're supposed to try these out,

put in these faces, and see what we get. So, uh

Start with this one.

[crumbling]

[crumbling stops]

So this is the room corresponding to the face on the gravestone.

Not sure what that is, on the right.

Alright.

Gonna try the other one now, I guess.

Nothing,

nothing to see here.

The bed's empty.

[crumbling]

[crumbling stops]

Here's the other room.

Uh,

and it looks like there's something here.

Uh.

What am I reading?

I'm not sure what to say about that.

But, I'm wondering now,

because the note,

remember, the note

that came with

this game...

It said "For you:"

It was

"For you." And,

this note is referring to the player, it's saying "you,"

uh,

and,

I was already thinking this, but, uh,

it seems like

uh, it's possible this game was made for

well, this part of the game, was made for somebody to see.

Like, or at least at some point, it was,

it was, uh,

I don't know.

I don't know. It just seems like there was,

it was intended for somebody.

Not me, certainly.

Uh.

Okay.

We're still not done, because we still have whatever is over here.

Or not.

Okay.

So, okay. I'll just end this here, then. Heh.


Petscop 4
So, if you remember what I was trying to explain yesterday

and failed to explain,

um, I'm just gonna demonstrate that to you now.

Here we go.

So, I found this yesterday.

And, uh, the way, I understand this is,

so, we're upstairs right now.

Uh, you just saw me walk up some stairs.

So,

if you were to imagine

what is, what would be exactly below where I'm standing right now?

Uh, and I worked it out. It's roughly, uh,

the area where you have the big screen,

uh, with the windmill.

Uh, and so I think,

so this, this I think is a camera,

and if I, uh,

walk in this direction,

this is, uh, roughly

where the, uh, windmill would be.

Why there isn't actually a windmill here, I don't know.

Uh, it looks sort of like a placeholder for it.

Uh.

But yeah, I think my understanding is correct.

It's just, uh, I'm missing something.

Okay, that's it.



Petscop 5
Uh, alright, so I spent a while with this

just asking as many questions as I could think of.

Uh, mostly like, short three-word things, uh,

and uh, most of the questions that I asked just produced no answer,

or, uh, the default answer,

the default answer, which is, "I don't know."

Most of them just gave me that.

Except for four of them. Uh, and I'm gonna go through each of those four now.

Uh, the first of the four was

"Who is Tiara?"

And, uh, capitalization does not make a difference.

But, uh, "Who is Tiara?"

I also tried "Who is Care?", "Who is Mike?", "Who is Michael?"

And I tried other forms too, like, uh,

uh, just "Care?", just "Mike?", just "Michael?"

This is the only one that, uh, gave me anything.

Uh, next one that I tried, I think...

Oh yeah.

Next, I asked "Where am I?"

Um, and then I asked, uh, "Who are you?"

Uh. I don't know why that just happened.

Uh.

Yeah, so I was saying,

uh,

"Who"... "Who are you?" Yeah.

I don't know why that just changed color out of nowhere.

I think it broke.

Yeah, I don't think that even just, just registered at all.

Or, uh,

okay.

So, that's not,

that's not what it said before, when I put in that question.

Did not look anything like that.

That's interesting.

Heh.

Okay,

uh, what, what do I ask now?

"Why",

"Why turn off",

I'll try just "Why?"

Okay.

Oh boy.

Uh.

Yeah, I don't...

What the fuck?

This fucking game.

Heh.

This game.

Okay, um.

Alright, what do I,

what do I have to ask, now?

Um, "What"...

...and it switched back again.

I th...

...think it just...

Okay.

Um.

I don't...

So if I, if I put in, what was it,

if I put in "Who are you?" again, is that gonna,

let me see what happens when I put that in. Again.

Yeah, so that's what it said originally, when I put it in.

Well, okay, that's bizarre.

Um.

So, I guess I'm gonna wait for that to happen again.

Uh, but I guess I'm gonna end the video now, though. Uh.



Petscop 6
[dark sound]

[dark sound]

[quiet rumbling]

[rumbling stops]

[rumbling resumes]

[rumbling stops]

That was kind of fun, actually.

Going through a four-hour video

and noticing that

on one half of the video, the windmill is going one direction,

and, in the other half, it's going in the other direction.

And uh,

pinpointing where the change occurred,

and uh, "the fuck is this?"

[quiet rumbling]

That's neat.

Well, that's red now.

Oh, uh,

yeah, I was gonna mention this, actually, in a,

another video. I've come up here before and seen it,

I've seen the camera at this height before. Uh.

I don't know what causes it to happen, but, uh,

sometimes I just come up here and it's at this height.

Uh, it makes sense in this case, I think,

because the character was, like, right up at the camera, here.

Uh, and it seemed to be, like, at this level. Um.

[laughs]

Well, uh, this is still here.

Oh my god.

Oh my god.

[very quiet tune ♪]

Nothin' else. Okay.

Let's look at what we got.

Uh-oh.

Uh.

Uh-oh.

"I was the only one who still wanted to put him down."

Um.

What have, what have I just walked into?

Oh, that's it.

[laughs]

Yeah, okay.

Um.

That's...

Okay, so, I actually...

This is, this is new to me. I haven't seen this.

Yeah, so I, I tried going down here before.

But I think, actually, that was before I even put in the code.

So, I just discovered this, just now.

Um.

But you know what, I think, actually, this,

I think I know what this is. This is our, uh, "A, B, NLM."

You know, you recognize the shape of this one.

And then you have...

So, I don't know what this is here, though. Um.

Yeah, so I didn't imagine you could catch this. I mean, um,

I walked into it. Nothing happened.

Discovering a lot of interesting things.

Oh, uh,

whoops.

I meant to

talk about this. Because this doesn't do anything.

Right. This menu option, nothing happens.

I'm guessing at some point you could name your pets.

Uh.

Right, and this was, like, suggestions or something.

Uh, yeah. Yeah, so just, uh,

showing that that doesn't do anything.

Alright.

Hm.

Alright.

[rumbling stops]

Hm.

This game is trying very hard to make it seem like,

um,

like there's an entity in it.

Like, uh, a ghost,

or an AI, trying to communicate with me.

It's interesting.

But you know, the way you know

that there's a ghost in a game trying to communicate with you,

is if it comes out.

If it stops being

distant, and it comes out, and you can have a,

you know, a real-time back and forth with it.

Um.

And it stops being so one-way. Like I,

I leave my PlayStation, and it comes,

comes out and, uh,

does this whole pre-recorded thing.

Uh.

And, well,

the closest thing that's happened to that, is

last video, you know, it actually answers my questions.

But, you know, it only responded to two of my questions,

and the first one, the first question I asked,

it didn't even answer that question. So, uh,

no obvious interactivity happening.

You know, and, it answered the second question, but that could have been a coincidence.

Um, yeah.

So, uh, not entirely convincing yet.

But, you know, looking forward to what I might see next.

It's very interesting, this game. Uh,

because you can walk around and something will just happen.

You know?

Because I created a new file, and uh,

I tried to be scientific about it,

I went, I went uh, and did all the same things that I did this time,

and, uh, the same things did not happen.

Uh, none of the things happened, none of the oddities occurred.

Like, the thing in the mirror room, for example. Um,

so, there's a bit of randomness in it, and it's interesting how it doesn't seem

to really care if you see everything, I guess.

Uh.

Yeah, so it's interesting.


Petscop 7
[turning pages]

[tune in left speaker ♪]

Something's happening.

[tune continues ♪]

[tune stops]

Oh, hi there.

Is that

it?

That might be it.

Except, what is,

uh, okay.

Hm!

So, we might know who Marvin is, now.

Oh, I need to be quick about this, actually.

Because it could turn red again. Um.

So I'm gonna ask, "Who are you?",

which I feel like we know at this point, but,

good to confirm.

It's talking about the house again.

It's interesting, but it is not an answer to my question.

Not at all.

So, um, what do you think that means?

Uh, okay, I should...

So, yeah, so now I'm gonna the other question, the...

"Do you remember being born?" Oh yeah, it's just, uh,

"Remember being born?", because the whole thing does not fit.

"Machine beyond school basement stairway."

Uh.

Not, also not an answer to my question.

Um.

Yeah, and it, yeah, well...

Well, there you go.

"Child library accepts people."

Okay, well, I guess I'm kind of an idiot.

I wouldn't have tried that.

I guess these, these are people, right?

Those might work.

Yeah.

So, if I walk over here,

what happened?

Yeah, it's just normal.

Okay, so, that's another thing.

[crumbling]

[crumbling stops]

Anything out of the ordinary here?

What's on the floor?

It looks like a gift box,

and stars, and something else.

And, anything down here?

As usual, no.

Um, so this, if you're wondering what I'm doing here,

this is mike's face, but without the eyebrows.

Um, and why am I doing that? Well, because eyebrows seem to be important.

Uh.

And that's really it. Um, but,

uh, nothing seems to have actually,

it seems like it's just one regular room, right.

Uh.

Yeah, okay. I don't know, I guess that's it.

Alright, I have one more thing to try, though.

[crumbling]

[crumbling stops]

This one is Care with eyebrows.

So, this is Care with eyebrows.

I put Mike's eyebrows on her.

Um, I could have put other eyebrows on her, but I didn't.

I put Mike's on her. Um.

I don't know if this... I, I can't tell...

I can't tell if it recognized it or not,

because everything looks

like any other room.

Except, it puts this here.

Except, it puts

this...

I don't know. Maybe that's just something that it puts in any room.


Petscop 8
What?

Uhh. What?

This is Marvin, right?

This is Marvin.

I think you're confused, Marvin.

Don't think you know what you're,

I don't think you get what you're, uh, what you're doing.

What?

Excuse me?

He went up.

Will I find him if I go up?

I don't know.

Yeah, well, the thing is, it's not here now.

There's not even a passageway or anything.

Can you remember when you saw this?

Well, it could have changed between then and 2004.

After 2004 my mom had it, purportedly.

...were signs along the way. Um, that I ignored.

Because it would have been a completely ridiculous idea to me.

Um.

But when I found my room,

it made, uh,

well, I was shocked at first, but it made sense,

especially considering where I found the game in the first place,

um,

that it would be tied, in some way, to me through you. Um.

And I'm trying to think, when was the last time I saw any of you at all?

It had to have been in like, 1999. I was a kid, I was a small kid.

Tiny kid.

Um.

And after that, just, you know.

But, it would make sense in the timeline.

So, it's hard to do this while I'm talking, that's why I'm so

quiet right now.

So, if you're wondering what I'm doing right now, um,

I have a drawing

that I could scan and send to you.

I just came home and drew this big drawing.

Um.

And it's still, you still need an explanation,

because the drawing is not very clear,

it's scribbles, really. But um,

but you need the visual to understand the explanation.

Right, so you need both.

I'm about 90% sure that this is gonna work.

Uh, 10% not so sure.

Um, but mostly sure.

Okay.

Uh, wait, wait, I think I did that wrong.

Start again. Wait.

Holy shit.

Holy shit.

It worked.

I mean, I was 90% sure, but,

[laughs]

still a little shocking that it actually worked.

That's very neat. Um.

Alright, so, the way this works, I'm supposed to pass on this one.

Haha.

There it is.

Okay.

Okay.

So this one, we wanna,

um, what do we wanna...

I wanna ask about the house,

so we wanna ask "where" ... "where is house?"

Okay.

Okay.

Um.

So, I don't, I don't know...

I, I mean, it's probably just asking me to go this way, right?

Yeah, I think that's what's happening.

That's not what I was expecting, actually.

Um,

I guess a, a road makes sense.

Um, but it's not visually the same thing that I was expecting to see.

See what the camera just did there?

It's a frozen house... I think we found the house.

I don't know what that...

We just found the fuckin' house.

We found the house. The key still w...

What?

What?

Y, you...

Can't open it.

...another joke about how I can't open doors.

...clockwise, the top is going to the right,

and then, you know, the bottom is going to the left,

right, and so, when someone would say, uh, um,

"righty tighty, lefty loosey,"
[quiet tune ♪]

or, you know,  "turn this thing to the right," um.

And, I mean, I still get confused about that.

Um.

Well, we have

I don't remember meeting this girl at all.

Um, I don't remember knowing her

[clinking]
Um, I don't remember knowing her

at any point.

Um, and I remember you saying that we were,

that we, we are, um,

exactly the same age.

[deep indiscernible speech]
Right.

I, I just don't remember even hearing about anyone going missing.

Right, I don't have a single...

I don't remember her going missing.

I don't remember anything like that. I mean, I was a kid...

but even then...

Could have been one of those periods when we weren't visiting very much, but, uh,

just seems weird. Um, right, 'cause,

I don't know if you can, you can verify these dates, but um,

5th of June,

10th of November.

Right, when she went missing, and when she, uh,

[clinking]
Right, when she went missing, and when she, uh,

Right, when she went missing, and when she, uh,

was found.

Right.

And the 25th here, I'm wondering what that, uh,

what the animation means there.

Right, how the number is animating a bit.

Because... right,

[clinking with reverb]
uh, the 25th of December on both calendars,

but they're different years,

so I don't know if it means

it's the 25th of December in this house,

but then it's two different years, so that's...

[deep indiscernible speech]

I do agree there's a resemblance.
[deep indiscernible speech]

Um.

Very strong resemblance

[clinking with reverb]

Try it with that.

Um.

Yeah.

Let's try to get that.

Heh.

Yeah, these two are definitely...

It's blocking it.

Right, so it comes up.

And if I...

Oh!

Heh.

Wow, okay.

This is...

Okay.

Wha--

Okay, this is a new file.

Uh, it might have occurred to you, as it occurred to me, that,

uh, these rooms are,

uh, this room and the, uh, house, are counterparts

because they both have this bucket,

and they are shaped similarly, so I thought I would try out,

uh, what we did before. Uh, this bucket is annoying to move around.

Uh, is this gonna,

yeah.

And, uh, it worked.

God, am I gonna be able to get this through the...

Okay. Hm.

Can I...

This is working out pretty well.

And I'm feeling some doubt, because this bucket seems way too

small.

Uh, but I should not have felt doubt.

It just worked.

Petscop 14
[background music: "explore-min" ♪]

...I can't just wait.

Um, thankfully I have been,

uh, suddenly inspired by an idea

that is, in a way, similar to the idea that brought me to this house.

Um,

because, that idea involved pretending.

Pretending something was there that wasn't there.

And this idea involves pretending that this door, right here,

this one,

is open, rather than closed.

You can see that it's closed. Um, but,

what I'm going to do, and what I invite you to do as well, is picture,

I'm going to picture, in my head,

that this door is actually open right now. Um.

And if I were to pass through this doorway, um,

what would happen, I would...

Would I bump into a door? No, because,

the door is open. Right?

I would just keep going, into the room that's there.

And I happen to know -- I'm gonna walk into the room right now.

Um, do do do... I'm in the room.

I happen to know what this room looks like,

because I saw it in a demo recording just today.

Um, and you can see it, too. I assume it will be up on the family youtube,

along with this video that I'm recording right now. Um,

we can see what the room looks like in that recording,

um, on the uh, right? ... Left? Left? Right ... side.

There's a windmill.

Now, I don't have it in front of me right now. I should. Um.

On the right side, there's a windmill. On the left side,

there's something that, um, Marvin does not bother to look at,

but we will be looking at. Um.

So, um, the question is, what do I do next,

if I, if I were in this room right now, would I...

um, I wanna go to the thing that Marvin didn't look at.

So I'm gonna go to the right.

Um, and I think...

So, if I go to the right... ugh, god, I think I went a little too far, actually.

Uh, nope. Well,

I think, actually, what happens here...

The problem is that it's, uh, kind of a branching point,

I could stop, I could be blocked by the beds,

or I could keep going past the beds, to the other side of the room,

so I could actually be on either side of the room right now.

Um.

But either way, I guess it doesn't matter, but I'm going to assume,

um, I'm on the thing, that I got blocked by the beds,

and if I go up, up up up up,

uh, just keep going up... um,

there will be a question mark that appears,

that will let me go and do something.

Um, and if I press X, something will happen.

Um, and, what will happen?

I think, possibly, a text box will open.

'Cause that's what happens with the windmill, right?

Um, I'm gonna press, I pressed X, and a text box appeared.

with text in it,

that is probably cryptic, and we don't really care too much about,

so we're gonna press X a bunch of times, um,

to get through all the text.

Um, but we can look at it later.

Um, and there could be a lot of it, so I'm...

Could be like, like a book

in there, lot of stuff we don't care about.

Lot of it.

Or!

Or, it's not a text box, and it could be literally anything else in the world,

um, that happens when you, when you press X,

uh, so, the next

thing I can think to do,

is just press buttons. Randomly.

Um, and chaotically.

And hopefully we'll, you know, see some results,

so I'm, I'm doing that right now, I don't know if you can hear that, uh,

I'm being real, um,

chaotic right now, with the controller.

And I'm thinkin', you know,

I'm thinkin' I'm being really productive right now.

I think I'm definitely being really productive.

Um, it's just that we can't, really...

see it.

Hey cat, what are you doing?

Stupid.

Yeah.

[Paul hums Care's melody]

I've been playing this game too fuckin' much. [slaps controller]

Oka--

And so, the windmill isn't there.

I think I can... so, I get blocked by the, I do get blocked by the beds.

Um.

And I go up, uh...

I think,

oh god, I could be doing this...

I shouldn't be doing this while I'm talking, so,

anyway, what was I...

So, I've seen, I've actually seen recordings

that it made of me

from a year ago.

Um, and I had not seen that recording in the time between,

so it was holding on to this thing,

and only decided a year later to play it back. Um.

There are also, um, recordings

that I assume are stored on the CD, or might even be scripted.

But, um, in one of the recent videos,

this was, this was one that went on the public youtube, um,

I lost the video,

I lost it, um, I had the audio, um,

the game had the recording.

Even... There were two parts to this, this session.

Uh, it had both of them. It played them back, two different occasions,

as demo recordings, I got them,

but... Okay, so, here's the thing.

Those, um,

those demo recordings can be different.

Right, they can be different from when I was playing.

The one, so, when I caught all those pets, and it showed the text,

um,

that was different from what it showed when I was playing.

It, it showed something, it happened to line up, right, perfectly, uh,

same number of text boxes and so forth,

um, and also, the music wasn't there in the demo. Um.

There can be differences. And,

this...

was part of what made it seem reasonable that the door could be open.

Um, I'm not saying it wasn't still nuts.

So, I'm actually, I'm gonna do this now, so, uh...

Right, so, I'm assuming that Triangle is back, but,

it could be Square, Circle, I'm gonna just do all of them. Um.

Okay.

I can actually, I think I can rotate these.

Um.

Okay.

Um,

so, I mean, I could have

gone just totally off the rails

by this point. I could be anywhere.

So, Attempt 5 was this room over here.

Um, and now, Attempt 6, we're going to try to

push the bucket

into the other room,

going back to this room, now.

Uh,

again, gotta make sure this is aligned exactly right.

Uh, hm.

This?

Okay.

So, now, this way.

And, um, I'm just going to leave it there,

and see what happens.

Trying again.

This is Attempt...

22.

And,

I think that's right?

Right, now we don't have to worry about that.

One, two, three, four, five, six.

Okay.

Now...

[plopping sounds]

Hey there.

How's it going?

Yeah, I'm okay. What do you think of that picture?

Yeah, so I,

I, I went up, and I typed  "where is the windmill?",

and that didn't work,

and so, uh,

I tried "where was the windmill?"

and that's how I got the text.

In the picture.

Yeah. Yeah, I looked them up.

The top numbers, I looked them up.

Uh,

you, you're gonna want to look them up yourself.

Yeah, punch 'em in.

Yeah.

I'll wait.

It's a, it's a two.

I know!

I know, me too.

That, that was what, f-- first thought. First thought.

There's not a lot of detail.

Uh, but,

it looks like a stone, right?

Not yet, actually, I wanted to go with you, tomorrow.

Uh, that's why I...

we, yeah.

Friday.

How about that?

Okay. No, I'm gonna sit on it, until then.

I'm, I'm not showing the family until I've seen it myself.

Yeah... well, I don't, I don't,

I don't know, I'm not recording. I stopped it.

Uh, so, what do you think of the bottom numbers?

No, they're different. I wanna hear what you think, first.

Mm, ye-- yeah, yup. Yup.

Yup.

Yeah, we, we would have to find out how big.

Like, we have to find out how big a tile is,

one of the tiles.

Like, if we, if we could figure out how big

one tile is,

in uni--, in, um, like, feet.

Or, uh yeah, meters.

If we could...

what I'm thinking is, if we could measure how far away

the staircase is,

the, the staircase is, from the windmill,

the staircase closest, you know,

the one that's closest to the windmill,

if we could measure how far away that is,

from the windmill,

what I'm wondering,

is, if we could find something there.

Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, exactly, we could do that.

Uh, it's, uh,

I mean, this is, this,

it's unlikely, this is already pretty...

It's exciting.

This is why I'm not telling the family, because it's exciting. Uh.

Um, but it's unlikely, but it's still, it's still worth a try,

and, what I think, what I'm thinking

we should do,

go and measure the stone on the ground,

compare it to the size of the windmill in the game,

and then we can use that for conversions.

Which, we can do it based on tiles,

how far we can walk in a second, like speed,

whatever, whatever is the easy way to

do what I'm thinking.

Sure.

And, oh, I think it's more, I think it's more likely we

could use real life to find things in the game,

like, the reverse.

Um,

which, we can, we can do that,

and then we don't have to, like, aimlessly walk around to find stuff.

That would be interesting.

Right? If we could take...

That, that's, yup. Yup.

I know, isn't this...

I can probably just measure the stone now, from the,

from the satellite right now, roughly.

Uh, no, they don't know much more than we do now. They didn't...

I don't like talking to them. They intimidate me.

Uh, and I'm sure they wouldn't intimidate you, at all.

Yeah, have they called you?

They haven't called you, right?

I mean, Jill specifically, she hasn't called you?

No, I, I didn't voluntarily mention you.

She asked,

because,

'cause, you know, I'm talking to you in the first few videos.

Right? And so she asked who, who I'm talking to

in the videos, and so I told her, but,

she didn't ask anything else, so I don't think she actually cares.

Yeah.

And, I don't, and you don't have to worry about it, right? 'Cause,

'cause you aren't, you aren't family, so you wouldn't have a room.

That's the thing.

Uh.

I, I didn't mean it that way, just,

you probably don't have a room, that's, that's my only point.

Yeah, no, it's fine.

Uh, no, you don't want her calling you anyway.

Like, you won't be able,

you won't be able to escape, that's the thing,

if she were to start... yeah.

And I should start taking you up on that offer.

Hey, I need your genius.

I need your, um...

Trying to

navigate here.

Yeah, I need your, I need your puzzle genius.

No, no, you're,

you're a genius.

Wait, let me,

let me get there before I start talking about this.

You sure?

Yeah. You weren't in the middle of something, were you?

I can let you go.

Good, well, okay, so,

I was expecting the cage puzzle to lead into something else,

Uh, but there's really nothing here

left.

Yeah. Um.

The Tiara character is gone, now.

Yeah, completely, like, you look over on the other side,

and now there's noth-- there was, there was,

like, the, the Tiara character was there,

and then I left, and then the next time I came back,

they were gone.

What do you mean, "of course"?

Give me a second to verify that logic.
